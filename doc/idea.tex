\begin{abstract}
A distributed revision control system (DRCS), distributed version control or
decentralized version control system (DVCS) keeps track of software revisions
and allows many developers to work on a given project without necessarily
being connected to a common network \cite{wiki}. Some of the popular
distributed version control systems are Git \cite{git}, Mercurial
\cite{mercurial}, darc \cite{darcs}, GNU Bazaar \cite{bazaar} etc. Distributed Version Control
Systems usually follow peer to peer approach rather than client server. So
instead of a central repository to which each client can synchronize their
changes, each peer has a working copy of the codebase. DVCS usually perform
syncronizations by exchanging patches between peers.

In this project we will be implementing a distributed version control
system with basic features like commit, push patch, pull patch, view history,
merging of code files, reverting changes etc.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Approach}
We will devide the whole project into ? subsystems which consists of :

\subsection{Networking}
Networking subsystem implements the underlying communication between the
peers. It will consists of
\begin{itemize}
\item Defining the underlying z
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Code Revision System}
